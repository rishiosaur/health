Dear Honourable MPP Singh,

CC: Honourable Health Minister Elliott

I am writing to you today on behalf of more than 4 000 Brampton citizens treated for severe conditions exclusively in the grimiest hallways of Brampton's largest hospital. Today,  I am writing to you representing the 18 000 signees of our city's most massive healthcare reform petition. I am writing to you today in solidarity with the 500 000 patients who receive subpar healthcare at Brampton Civic Hospital every year — the hospital created uniquely to serve Brampton's needs.

When my father developed a fever and sore aches, it took more than two days off and countless hours spent pacing only to begin the process of getting treated. When my closest friend first developed symptoms of COVID-19, it took more than three days to go through the testing process. When Jamie-Lee Ball was bleeding internally, and her screams echoed throughout the Brampton Civic Hospital, she never received care. Stories like these may seem extreme, but they are far from unique in this so-called "first world" city. From the very beginning, Brampton's healthcare funding has never been a priority for Ontario. Despite being one of the fastest-growing cities in all of Canada, we have consistently received significantly less funding than our neighbouring towns: in the current administration, we receive the lowest funding per capita, at just $937, a far cry compared to the provincial average of $2000. Although we've struggled along with that meagre funding for years, the enormous socioeconomic disparities that it has caused are now starting to show.

Civilians are starting to see the disastrous effects of the provincial government's negligence first-hand as we move into a COVID-normalized world: Brampton recently surpassed Toronto as Canada's largest hotspot in COVID-19 cases and deaths per capita, and a 'healthcare emergency' was declared unanimously by our city council two months before COVID-19 ever hit. Hospitals are now operating at up to 7.5x their recommended capacity, leading to one of the worst pandemic responses in the nation, which has trickle-down effects in nearly every part of the city—affecting nearly every single person on an unimaginable scale. Staff and students at school and publicly-funded institutions are all scrambling to have a shot at normalcy and a chance to have a real education, but without a well-functioning healthcare system, no plan will ever be truly foolproof, leaving our most vulnerable populations hung out to dry—we don't even have one full bed for every thousand citizens Employers and our foremost business leaders need to pay more money for longer and more frequent hospital visits—which not only means that our workers and massive labour force cannot work as efficiently, but that our city is at risk of a recession. The lack of healthcare funding has put our city into a vicious cycle of economic downfall; healthcare funding is an issue that affects every facet of our town, not just a single demographic. It’s the single thing that ties us all together. When it fails, it puts every single person in this city at risk as individuals.

I am 14. Instead of worrying about tests and getting into university, I now have to worry about whether our crowded hospitals are safe for my family to attend. I need to worry about what my friends are doing at school so that none of us have to spend the night unattended on a stretcher. Brampton is at its breaking point, and change has to come fast. For Brampton to even start to meet the provincial average for healthcare, the provincial government has to invest a fair amount into this city; a base amount of approximately $600 million would be needed just for Brampton to reach provincial standards, taking into account the current population of Brampton, standards in hospital work, and recent work that is being done on hospitals. That funding would drastically increase the deficit that Mr. Ford has been so careful about dismantling, but at this point, the deficit in humanity is too much to bear.

This investment would put Brampton's healthcare infrastructure well on the way to success: it would allow us to adequately address our population during this crisis, drastically speed up construction on our other hospital projects and build out new infrastructure for our current ones running overcapacity. Most importantly, this would be an investment that has future implications — healthcare infrastructure does not get removed after a year. The protocols, buildings, staff, and situations that the funding would allow would ensure that Brampton remains a safe and equitable place for all citizens for years to come, and would mean that all of our workers can keep contributing to the economy, yielding a net positive result. Like every other political issue, Brampton's healthcare crisis can be viewed from a multitude of perspectives. However, this singular catastrophic issue stems from something that the government can solve exclusively with funding: a severe lack of resources.

As Justin Trudeau so aptly put it in his speech addressing the nation, this will be expensive — for both taxpayers and the government. However, if the provincial government does not take swift action, the economic, interpersonal, and social consequences of Brampton's severely underfunded healthcare system during COVID will be more expensive than any financial statement can ever represent. During this crisis, we'll be losing money no matter what, but whether or not our city loses more lives is up to you.

Sincerely,

Rishi Kothari.
