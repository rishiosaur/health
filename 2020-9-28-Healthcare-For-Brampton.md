Dear *Hon. Premier Ford* and *Minister Singh*,

I am writing to you today on behalf of more than 4 000 Brampton citizens treated exclusively in the grimy hallways of Brampton’s largest hospital. I am writing to you today on behalf of the 18 000 individuals that signed our city’s largest healthcare reform petition—the same one that your government decided to ignore. I am writing to you today on behalf of the 500 000 patients that receive subpar healthcare at William Osler: the hospital that was created uniquely to serve our needs.

When my own father developed a fever and sore aches, it took more than 2 days off and countless hours spent pacing to merely start the process of getting treated. When my closest friend developed symptoms of COVID-19, it took more than 3 days to go through the testing process. When Jamie-Lee Ball was bleeding internally and her screams were echoing throughout the Brampton Civic Hospital, she never received care. 

Stories like these may seem extreme, but they are far from unique in this so-called “first world” city. From the beginning, Brampton's healthcare funding has never been a priority for Ontario. Despite being one of the fastest-growing cities in all of Canada, we have consistently received significantly less funding than our neighbouring cities: in the current administration, we receive the lowest funding per capita, at just $937, a far cry compared to the provincial average of $2000—despite electing this government on the basis of platform such as “Plans for the People.”

Thousands of civilians are starting to see the disastrous effects of the provincial government's negligence as we move into a COVID-normalized world: Brampton recently surpassed Toronto as Canada's largest hotspots in cases and deaths per capita, and a 'healthcare emergency' was declared unanimously by our city council 2 months before COVID-19 ever hit. Hospitals are now operating at up to 7.5x their recommended capacity, leading to a terribly fractured pandemic response, which has trickle-down effects in nearly every part of the city. Teachers and students are all scrambling to have a shot at normalcy, but without our healthcare system, no plan will ever be truly foolproof, leaving our most vulnerable populations hung out to dry. Employers need to pay more money for longer and more frequent hospital visits, which not only means that our workers and massive labour force cannot work as efficiently, but that our city is at risk of a recession. 

Healthcare is fundamental to any society's functioning, but it is clear that the provincial government doesn’t think that this applies to Brampton; despite having more than twice the population of our neighbouring city of Etobicoke, we have received less than 0.002% of their funding. In the most dire health crisis of this generation, Brampton’s lack of funding has left us severely underprepared; our hospitals are overflowing, with 'hallway medicine' becoming the norm, and nearly every sector of our population is in danger.

I am 14. Instead of worrying about tests and getting into university, I now have to worry about whether or not our crowded hospitals are safe for my family to go to. I need to worry about what my friends are doing, so that none of us have to spend the night unattended in a stretcher. Brampton is at its breaking point, and change has to come fast. In order for Brampton to even start to meet the provincial average for healthcare, the provincial government has to invest an equitable amount into this city; disregarding the lack of funding for previous years, a base amount of about $600 million would be the total cost, taking into account the current population of Brampton, standards in hospital work, and current work that’s being done on hospitals. That funding would drastically increase the deficit that Mr. Ford’s been so careful about dismantling, but at this point, the deficit in humanity is too much to bear.

This investment would put Brampton’s healthcare well on the way to success: it’d allow us to properly address our population during this crisis, drastically speed up construction on our other hospital projects and build out new infrastructure for our current ones running over capacity. Most importantly, this would be an investment that has future implications—Healthcare infrastructure isn’t a concept that gets removed after a year. The protocols, buildings, staff, and situations that the funding would allow for would ensure that Brampton remains a safe and equitable place for all citizens for years to come.

As Justin Trudeau so aptly put it in his speech addressing the nation, this will be expensive. However, if swift action is not taken, the economic, interpersonal, and social consequences of Brampton's severely underfunded healthcare system during COVID will be more expensive than money can ever represent.
